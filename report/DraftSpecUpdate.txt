changes from draft spec:

We never got around to doing a Fibonacci Heap, but our algorithm seems to run fine with just a binary minheap splay tree.

For the user interface, we did not make a website. Our program is run from the Appliance terminal. No editing of code is required to get it to run, although it does recreate the same graph every time it runs.

None of the "cool extensions" were done.
