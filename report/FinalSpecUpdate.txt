changes from final spec

Schedule:
Daniel got a concussion which left our team behind a week plus.
Dan worked on the File I/O -> getting Wikipedia pages into oCaml in graph form.
Jason and Dan worked on Graph module and LookupTable
Jane worked on priority queue.
Daniel and Jason wrote Dijkstra's and tested it, got all the code working.
Dan made the video.
Jason did the writeup.
Dan edited the writeup and submitted the project.

Interfaces:
We never had a node interface.
We instead had a StringKey module which basically wrapped string to pass into Map.Make functor.
Our nodes were StringKey.t's (basically strings)
We never sealed our Graph module so we never used our GRAPH signature.
In Graph, neighbors was renamed get_neighbors and nodes was renamed get_nodes.
We never saw a use for delete so we never implemented delete (it would have been hard, too).
In Pqueue, add and take were renamed insert and remove.
module Minheap was in fact sealed using PRIORITYQUEUE
